## Problem Statement

FRONT-END WEB DEVELOPER ASSESSMENT

### Instructions:

You will create a simple currency converter application in ReactJs. The application shows the
price of 1 Bitcoin in different currencies.

### Essentials your applications should have:

You will implement...

- [x] A ReactJs app that should look and feel like the image above.
- [x] The currency selector drop-down should have three currencies to choose from.
      a. United States Dollar (USD)
      b. British Pound Sterling (GBP)
      c. Euro (EUR)
- [x] For the chart, you can choose any charting library. We suggest you use
      https://www.chartjs.org/
- [x] The currency value and the chart must be updated whenever a currency is selected from
      the drop-down.
- [x] Bonus points if you use Redux and Saga.

### For extra fun, you can try the following:

- [x] 1. clicking on bank name would redirect to a bank page, with a route like banks/{bankid}
     that displays the details of the bank
     Please note: below mock-ups are for reference only. You are free to do the styling as you
     please.
